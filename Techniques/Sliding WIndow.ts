function slidingWindow(data, windowSize):

    right = 0
    window = empty data structure (could be a sum, map, set, etc.)
    result = initialize result (could be a list, max/min value, count, etc.)

    while right < data.length:
        // Expand the window
        add data[right] to window

        // Check if window size is achieved
        if (right - left + 1) >= windowSize:
            // Process current window
            update result based on window

            // Remove the leftmost element if we need to slide
            if (right - left + 1) > windowSize:

Key points about this generalized version:

1. `data` could be an array, string, or any iterable structure.

2. `window` is a flexible data structure. It could be:
   - A simple sum for problems involving sums or averages
   - A hash map for problems involving frequencies
   - A set for problems involving unique elements
   - Any other structure that fits the problem

3. `result` is also flexible. It could be:
   - A list of all valid windows
   - A single value (max, min, count, etc.)
   - Any other type of result the problem requires

4. The `add to window` and `remove from window` operations are generalized. Their implementation would depend on what `window` represents in your specific problem.

5. The `update result based on window` step is where you'd put the problem-specific logic.

6. This version allows for both fixed and variable size windows. For a fixed size window, you'd typically process it when `(right - left + 1) == windowSize`. For variable size windows, you might process it on every iteration and adjust the window size based on certain conditions.

This pseudo code provides a framework that can be adapted to many sliding window problems. The specific implementation details would depend on the problem at hand, but this structure covers the core concept of expanding the window, processing it, and then sliding it along the data.

Would you like to see how this could be adapted to a specific problem as an example?
