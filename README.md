## Introduction

LeetCode is a platform for practicing technical coding problems that help improve your coding skills. This repository is a compilation of my solutions to these problems, primarily using TypeScript. Each problem is solved with comments explaining the approach and thought process.

## Getting Started

To get started with running the solutions, you need to have Node.js and TypeScript installed on your machine.

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/leetcode-typescript-solutions.git
   cd leetcode-typescript-solutions
2. **Install TypeScript and ts-node:**

  ```bash
  npm install typescript ts-node @types/node --save-dev
```
**Initialize TypeScript configuration (if not already present):**

  ```bash

  npx tsc --init

  ```
# Running the Solutions

You can run each solution using ts-node. For example, to run the solution for problem1.ts in the easy directory:

  ```bash

  npx ts-node easy/problem1.ts
  ```
